# Linear Regression Model

This code implements a simple linear regression model to learn the relationship between input data x and output data y using gradient descent. The model predicts values based on the equation f(x)=m×x, where m represents the slope of the line. The code iteratively updates the slope m by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and actual values, adjusting m in the direction that reduces the error. By the end of the process, the model aims to find the best-fitting line that accurately represents the data.
##  The Process📜

- The mean squared error (MSE) is then calculated to measure the difference between the predicted values and the actual data y. The gradient of this error with respect to m is computed, indicating the direction and rate at which m should be adjusted to minimize the error.

- Using gradient descent, the slope m is iteratively updated by subtracting the product of the learning rate and the gradient from m. This process continues for a set number of epochs, gradually refining m until the model accurately captures the relationship between x and y.
